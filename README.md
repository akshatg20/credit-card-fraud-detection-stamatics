Detecting credit card fraud using Logistic Regression on the '[Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)'.

### Details about the dataset:
> The dataset contains 1000000 data points.
>
> We are trying to predict if a transaction made was fraudulent or not.
>
> 'fraud' is our binary independent variable.
>
> Data has no missing values.
>
> Dataset contains only 9% fraudulent transactions, i.e., it as an imbalanced dataset.


### Outlier Detection
> We remove data points which lie outside of “mean ± 3*standard deviation".
> 
> The final dataset has 963,001 data points.
